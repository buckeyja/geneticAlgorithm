This is a genetic algorithm which solves a blind maze. There are four parts to the genetic algorithm Populate, Crossover, Mutate and Person of Dominance. Populate generates a list of random paths which solve the maze. Crossover optimizes each path to reduce the length of the path. Mutate blends two separate paths into one more efficient path. Finally, Person of Dominance picks the shortest path and then displays a graphic showing a robot completing the maze.

To run the program simply run main.m and enter values when prompted. 

Note: This is a MatLab program.
